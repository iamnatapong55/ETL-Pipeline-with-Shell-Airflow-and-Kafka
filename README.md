# ETL-Pipeline-with-Shell-Airflow-and-Kafka

This personal project is based on IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate

After taking this course, I will be able to describe two different approaches to converting raw data into analytics-ready data. One approach is the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. The other contrasting approach is the Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) process. ETL processes apply to data warehouses and data marts. ELT processes apply to data lakes, where the data is transformed on demand by the requesting/calling application.  

Both ETL and ELT extract data from source systems, move the data through the data pipeline, and store the data in destination systems. During this course, I will experience how ELT and ETL processing differ and identify use cases for both. 

I will identify methods and tools used for extracting the data, merging extracted data either logically or physically, and for importing data into data repositories.  I will also define transformations to apply to source data to make the data credible, contextual, and accessible to data users. I will be able to outline some of the multiple methods for loading data into the destination system, verifying data quality, monitoring load failures, and the use of recovery mechanisms in case of failure.
